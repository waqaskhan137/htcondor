##Computing with HTCondorâ„¢
Our goal is to develop, implement, deploy, and evaluate mechanisms and policies that support High Throughput Computing (HTC)
on large collections of distributively owned computing resources. Guided by both the technological and sociological 
challenges of such a computing environment, the Center for High Throughput Computing at UW-Madison has been building the open source HTCondor distributed computing software (pronounced "aitch-tee-condor") and related technologies to enable scientists and engineers to increase their computing throughput.
